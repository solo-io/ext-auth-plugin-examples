# Copy the repository to the image and set it as the working directory. The GOPATH here is `/go`.
#
# You have to update the path here to the one corresponding to your repository. This is usually in the form:
# /go/src/github.com/YOUR_ORGANIZATION/PLUGIN_REPO_NAME
ADD . /go/src/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples

# De-vendor all the dependencies and move them to the GOPATH, so they will be loaded from there.
# We need this so that the import paths for any library shared between the plugins and Gloo are the same.
#
# For example, if we were to vendor the ext-auth-plugin dependency, the ext-auth-server would load the plugin interface
# as `GLOOE_REPO/vendor/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/api.ExtAuthPlugin`, while the plugin
# would instead implement `THIS_REPO/vendor/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/api.ExtAuthPlugin`. These would be seen
# by the go runtime as two different types, causing Gloo to fail.
# Also, some packages cause problems if loaded more than once. For example, loading `golang.org/x/net/trace` twice
# causes a panic (see here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24137). By flattening the dependencies this way we
# prevent these sorts of problems.
