  External auth plugin examples
</h1>

This repository contains example implementations of the 
[ExtAuthPlugin interface](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go) and a set 
of utilities that you can (and should!) use when building your own plugins.

Please refer to the [Auth Plugin Developer Guide](https://gloo.solo.io/dev/writing_auth_plugins/) for an in-depth 
explanation on how you can use this repository as a template to write your own Gloo Auth plugins.

---
**NOTE**

The following instructions are assuming you are targeting Gloo Enterprise `v1.x` releases. If you are using a `v0.x` 
version of Gloo Enterprise, please refer to [this revision](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/tree/v0.1.1) 
of this repository.

**Temporary note:** we have temporarily added the `gloo_e_deps_1.0.0-rc8` with the dependency information for Gloo 
Enterprise `v1.0.0-rc8`, so you are currently locked to this version. We are working on updating Gloo Enterprise to 
publish this file on each release.

## Makefile overview
Following is an overview of the most relevant `make` targets.

### get-glooe-info
When you are writing your own Ext Auth plugins, you must target a specific Gloo Enterprise version. This is because of the 
nature of Go plugins (you can find more info in [this section](https://gloo.solo.io/dev/writing_auth_plugins/#build-helper-tools) 
of the [Auth Plugin Developer Guide](https://gloo.solo.io/dev/writing_auth_plugins/)). With each release Gloo Enterprise publishes 
the information that you will require to replicate its build environment. You can get them by running

```bash
GLOOE_VERSION=<target-glooe-version> make get-glooe-info
```

where `GLOOE_VERSION` is the desired Gloo Enterprise version, e.g. `1.0.0-rc8`.

This will download the following files:
- `_glooe/build_env`: values to parameterize the plugin build with;
- `_glooe/dependencies`: the full list of the dependencies used by the `GLOOE_VERSION` version of Gloo Enterprise (
generated by running `go list -m all`);
- `_glooe/verify-plugins-linux-amd64`: a script to verify whether your plugin can be loaded by Gloo Enterprise.

### compare-deps
The `compare-deps` target compares the dependencies for your plugin with the one describing the Gloo Enterprise dependencies. 
It will succeed if the shared dependencies match _exactly_ (this is another constraint imposed by Go plugins, more info 
[here](https://gloo.solo.io/dev/writing_auth_plugins/#build-helper-tools)) and fail otherwise, outputting information 
about mismatches to stdout and a file.

In case of failure, this target also generates a file named `suggestions`, which contains entries that you can add to 
your `go.mod` file to bring your dependencies in sync with the Gloo Enterprise ones.

### build-plugins
The `build-plugins` target compiles the plugin inside a docker container using the `Dockerfile` at the root of this 
repository (this is done for reproducibility). It uses the information published by Gloo Enterprise to mirror its build 
environment and verify compatibility.

## Get example images
You can get the images for the example plugin(s) whose source code is contained in this repository by running:

```bash
docker pull quay.io/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins:<glooe_version>
```

where the tag `glooe_version` is the version of Gloo Enterprise you want to run the plugins with, e.g. `0.20.6`.

## Publishing your own plugins
To publish your own images you can just tag the image built in the `build-plugins` target (by adding add a `-t` option) 
and publish it to a docker registry that is reachable from the cluster you are running Gloo Enterprise in.

## Example workflow
First, store the version of Gloo Enterprise you want to target in an environment variable:
```
export GLOOE_VERSION=1.0.0-rc8
```

Run `compare-deps` to check if gloo and your plugin have different dependencies:

```
make GLOOE_VERSION=$GLOOE_VERSION compare-deps
```

If there are any mismatched dependencies, A file named `suggestions` will be created. Please use the contents of this 
file to update your `go.mod` file. This means replacing existing entries and adding missing entries.

Once you have updated the `go.mod` file, run the `compare-deps` target again. You might need to do this a few times 
before all the dependencies match.

Build the plugins using the `build-plugins` make target.
It is important to build the plugins using the `Makefile` as this will build them in a docker container
in such a way that they are compatible with Gloo Enterprise. This step will also verify that they can be loaded.

```
make GLOOE_VERSION=$GLOOE_VERSION build-plugins
```

This will build an anonymous container with the plugin for you. The output will look like so:
```
...
 ---> 4846ae5e0a4d
Step 15/16 : COPY --from=build-env /go/src/github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugin-examples/plugins/RequiredHeader.so /compiled-auth-plugins/
 ---> 1932dbdca716
Step 16/16 : CMD cp /compiled-auth-plugins/* /auth-plugins/
 ---> Running in c33580aff7e1
Removing intermediate container c33580aff7e1
 ---> c6d2a92c47e4
Successfully built c6d2a92c47e4
```

Specifically note the `Successfully built c6d2a92c47e4` line. 
In our case `c6d2a92c47e4` is the ID of the container just built.
To push this container, first re-tag it with your docker registry:

```
docker tag c6d2a92c47e4 username/dockerrepo:v1
```

And push it:

```
docker push username/dockerrepo:v1
```

You can now use this image to load your plugin into the Gloo Enterprise external auth server.
See [this section](https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest/security/auth/plugin_auth/#installation) of our docs 
for an example of how to do this.

## Common Errors
You might see an error similar to this one in the logs for the `build-plugins` target:
```
{"level":"error","ts":"2019-12-17T20:59:17.301Z","logger":"verify-plugins","caller":"scripts/verify_plugins.go:54","msg":"Plugin(s) cannot be loaded by Gloo","error":"failed to load plugin: failed to open plugin file: plugin.Open(\"plugins/RequiredHeader\"): plugin was built with a different version of package github.com/golang/protobuf/proto","errorVerbose":"failed to load plugin:\n    github.com/solo-io/go-utils/errors.Wrapf\n        /go/src/github.com/solo-io/go-utils/errors/utils.go:12\n  - failed to open plugin file:\n    github.com/solo-io/go-utils/errors.Wrapf\n        /go/src/github.com/solo-io/go-utils/errors/utils.go:12\n  - plugin.Open(\"plugins/RequiredHeader\"): plugin was built with a different version of package github.com/golang/protobuf/proto","stacktrace":"main.main\n\t/go/src/github.com/solo-io/solo-projects/projects/extauth/scripts/verify_plugins.go:54\nruntime.main\n\t/usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:200"}
```

This is caused by a dependency mismatch. Please run the `compare-deps` target and update your `go.mod` file.

Another common error is the following one, which can also appear in the logs for the `build-plugins` target :

```
panic: /debug/requests is already registered. You may have two independent copies of golang.org/x/net/trace in your binary, trying to maintain separate state. This may involve a vendored copy of golang.org/x/net/trace.
```

As the error message states, the cause for this error is most likely due to the fact that the `golang.org/x/net/trace` 
dependency is somehow present both in the `vendor` directory and in the `GOPATH` when the plugin is being built with 
the provided `Dockerfile`. We take extra precautions in the `Dockerfile` to de-vendor dependencies to avoid these errors; 
if modified the `Dockerfile`, please make sure that no `vendor` folder is present when `go build`ing the plugin.
