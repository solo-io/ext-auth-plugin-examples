  External auth plugin examples
</h1>

This repository contains example implementations of the 
[ExtAuthPlugin interface](https://github.com/solo-io/ext-auth-plugins/blob/master/api/interface.go) and a set 
of utilities that you can (and should!) use when building your own plugins.

Please refer to the [Auth Plugin Developer Guide](https://gloo.solo.io/dev/writing_auth_plugins/) for an in-depth 
explanation on how you can use this repository as a template to write your own Gloo Auth plugins.
