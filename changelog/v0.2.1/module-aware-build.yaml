changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
    Build plugins in _module-aware mode_ instead of in `GOPATH` mode (run go help modules for more info on build modes).
    This fix, together with the correspondent ones released with Gloo Enterprise `1.3.4` and `1.4.0-beta3`, addresses
    the compatibility issues that several users have encounter when building plugins for Gloo Enterprise 1.3 releases.
    Also, update the default Gloo Enterprise version for which to fetch dependencies to `1.3.4`.
